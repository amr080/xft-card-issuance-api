Our Services</h2><p>a) <strong>Our API and Solution</strong><br/>We provide you and your business with a card issuing platform (“<strong>Solution</strong>”), which can be used as agreed by you and us. We make the Solution available via a suite of application programming interfaces (“<strong>APIs</strong>”) and Web-based dashboards. We will provide you with API keys to access the Solution. From time to time, we may update the API and related documentation, including by deprecating or removing product features. Our<a href="https://docs.lithic.com/"> API documentation</a> is available on our website. We may also make additional API documentation available to you.<br/><br/>b) <strong>Support</strong><br/>We provide support on general issues related to your API account and your use of the Program. We make resources available through our API documentation and on our website’s support pages. You can also contact us<a href="https://www.lithic.com/contact"> online</a> or call us at 1-844-771-8229.<br/><br/>c) <strong>Program Management</strong><br/>We work with our Bank Partners to offer the Services. Our Bank Partners provide regulated financial services to you and your customers. These services may include opening card accounts with our Bank Partners. We act as program manager for these services. As part of the Solution, we will manage and perform some onboarding, compliance, customer service and financial partnerships functions.</p><p>We are responsible to our Bank Partners for compliance with Applicable Laws and industry requirements. In exchange for our performance of these responsibilities, you agree to assist us with our obligations to our Bank Partners. Your specific responsibilities are set forth under Section 2 — Your Obligations (collectively, with our efforts and operations, the “<strong>Program</strong>”). You agree that our Bank Partners may exercise direct monitoring, oversight, and control over the Program as our Bank Partners deem necessary. If requested by us or our Bank Partners, you agree to identify, designate, and keep up-to-date an individual that is responsible for receiving and promptly assisting with all inquiries from us or our Bank Partners, as applicable, relating to compliance with Applicable Laws; such individual may be the same individual appointed under Section 2(b)(i) of this Agreement.</p><p>From time to time, a new law, rule or requirement may be imposed on the Program by a Regulatory Authority, Payment Network, Bank Partner or similar third party (“<strong>Critical Change</strong>”). In the event of a Critical Change, you agree to cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to make any required changes to the Program. Until such time that the Program has been updated to address the Critical Change, we may take any actions necessary to ensure compliance with requirements and expectations from any Regulatory Authority, Payment Network, Bank Partner or similar third party. If a Critical Change impacts interchange revenue or other fees associated with the Program, we reserve the right to make corresponding adjustments to Customer Revenue share percentages and other financial terms.<br/><br/>d) <strong>Revenue Share</strong><br/>We will share a portion of the Program’s revenue in accordance with the<a href="https://lithic.com/pricing"> API Pricing section</a> of our website and other applicable terms of this Agreement (“Customer Revenue”). Customer Revenue will be measured based on monthly interchange-eligible transaction volume, net of any amounts returned to the Payment Networks due to chargebacks, refunds, disputes or other related transactions. For purposes of calculating percentages related to Customer Revenue, transaction volume will reset each month. We reserve the right to change Customer Revenue share percentages if the Payment Networks change network fees, change interchange rates or make some other change related to interchange rates. In the event you fail to comply with your obligations in this Agreement, including timely responses to our requests for information, we may withhold any Customer Revenue until such time you have fully remedied the noncompliance. If you and Lithic have not executed Enterprise Terms, we also may revise the Customer Revenue share percentages at any time; however, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with at least 15 days’ advance notice prior to changing the percentages applicable to you (or a longer period of notice if required by Applicable Law).</p><h2>2.

For purposes of this Program, you will either: (i) prefund all Cardholder spending into a For Benefit Of (“FBO”) Account at one or more of our Bank Partners; or (ii) fund all Cardholder spend by the following business day, whether from your own funds or by ensuring Cardholders agree to the relevant ACH authorizations and commit to daily withdrawals from such Cardholder’s own bank account to pay for the spend. In the event you choose to have Cardholders fund the Program directly, you are liable for any Cardholder spend that we are not able to recover directly from any such Cardholder. We and you must mutually agree on a funding structure prior to the Program exiting its beta product stage. The obligations of this Section are in addition to the minimum balance requirements set forth in Section 2.c.ii — Payment Reserve below.</h6><h6>ii.    <strong>Payment Reserve and Daily Limit</strong></h6><h6>To fund the Program’s payment volume, you must maintain a minimum reserve balance acceptable to us.

We and you must agree on an initial amount prior to the Program commencing operations. We may periodically require a different minimum balance to cover the purchases made through the Program. You must add funds each day to ensure the payment reserve holds enough funds to meet the minimum balance. You shall not be entitled to interest on the amounts held as a reserve balance.</h6><h6>We may use the funds on deposit in the payment reserve to satisfy any of your obligations to us under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, obligations related to fraud, payments, legal fees, fines, and indemnities.</h6><h6>We may suspend the creation of new cards, suspend all Cardholder access, and/or declare you in default of this Agreement if we must draw upon funds in the payment reserve more than three (3) times during a rolling twelve-month period of the Program, or if at any time the balance of funds in the payment reserve falls below the minimum reserve balance and you fail to replenish the payment reserve to the required level within two (2) business days after written notice from us.</h6><h6>We may set, and adjust from time to time in our sole discretion, a daily spending limit (“Daily Limit”) for the Program. The initial Daily Limit will be the Program’s reserve balance divided by three (3); provided, however, you may not unilaterally increase your Daily Limit by adding additional funds to the reserve balance. We may, at our sole discretion, increase or decrease the Daily Limit based on considerations such as Program transaction history, amounts in the reserve balance, credit and other risk considerations. You must monitor Program spend to ensure that it is always below the Daily Limit. If the Program’s daily authorized transactions are greater than the Daily Limit, we may, at our sole discretion, take action to address the matter, including but not limited to any combination of the following actions: 1) decline further transactions; 2) suspend the creation of new accounts, including new card creates; and 3) allow transactions in excess of the Daily Limit, provided we may assess late fees on any transactions in excess of the Daily Limit, and the late fee will be the lesser of 1.5% per month, or the highest rate permitted by law.</h6><h6>In connection with setting the Daily Limit, we may request you furnish information including but not limited to bank statements and financial statements. We reserve the right to suspend future transactions or suspend the creation of new accounts, including new card creates, if such information is not provided in a reasonable period of time.</h6><h6>iii.     <strong>Our Fees</strong></h6><h6>To access the Solution, you agree to pay the fees found in this Section and the<a href="https://lithic.com/pricing"> API Pricing</a> section of our website; provided, however, if you and Lithic execute Enterprise Terms, the Enterprise Terms will control. All fee, cost and expense amounts owed to us shall be deducted from your Customer Revenue amounts. To the extent fee, cost and expense amounts you owe us in any month are greater than the Customer Revenue amounts, we will debit such amounts from your linked funding source and (as needed) from funds held in the payment reserve.  Where applicable, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to pass through actual, attributable bank and network fees, but we reserve the right to estimate those fees when direct attribution is not possible. If your Enterprise Terms set forth per physical card pricing, we reserve the right to make adjustments to the per physical card pricing by providing you written notice.</h6><h6>iv.     <strong>Losses</strong></h6><h6>You are liable to us for any and all losses suffered or incurred by us or our Bank Partners in connection with the Program, including without limitation, settlement failures, chargebacks, Cardholder disputes, transaction disputes, over-limit processing, value load processing, under floor limit processing, losses, good faith credits, refunds, reversals, any overdrafts, negative balances, reversals of provisional credits and provisional credits, fraud losses, restitution payments to Cardholders, and claims and damage of any kind incurred by us with respect to transactions or claims of Cardholders, a Payment Network or a Regulatory Authority. We will submit to you invoices for any such losses incurred by us and you will pay such amounts immediately upon receipt of the invoice unless otherwise stated in this Agreement.</h6><h2><strong>3.

In no event will the disclosure of Confidential Information constitute the grant of any title, or any other ownership interest in such Confidential Information, whether express or implied, to you.</h6><h6>ii.     <strong>Disclosures to Program Related Parties</strong></h6><h6>Subject to the provisions of Section 3.a.iii — Termination of Obligations and Section 4.j — Assignment, you may disclose our Confidential Information to an affiliate or service provider that is performing any obligation of yours under this Agreement; except you may disclose only the Confidential Information that is necessary for the affiliate’s or service provider’s performance. Confidential Information disclosed to or accessed by your affiliates or service providers will remain your responsibility and constitute Confidential Information in your possession, custody or control for purposes of this Section 3.a — Confidentiality.</h6><h6>iii.     <strong>Termination of Obligations</strong></h6><h6>Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, at any time or upon the termination of this Agreement, you will, at our discretion: (a) return to us all materials belonging to us that constitute our Confidential Information, or (b) securely destroy our Confidential Information and provide us a written certification signed by an authorized officer of yours that all such information was destroyed; except that you may retain our Confidential Information to the extent required to comply with Applicable Law or Rules; provided that you will continue to maintain the confidentiality of our Confidential Information pursuant to the terms of Section 3.a — Confidentiality.</h6><p><strong>b) Data Security</strong></p><h6>i.     	<strong>Data Security Program</strong></h6><h6>You must establish and maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to: (a) protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of the Program Data and other Confidential Information; (b) ensure against any anticipated or emerging threats or hazards to its security and integrity; (c) protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information or associated records which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any User or Cardholder; and (d) ensure the proper disposal of Program Data (collectively, the “<strong>Data Security Program</strong>”).</h6><h6>ii.     <strong>Our Status as PCI Service Provider</strong></h6><h6>We comply with PCI DSS to the extent that we possess or otherwise store, process, or transmit cardholder data on behalf of customers, and to the extent that we could impact the security of your cardholder data environment.</h6><h6>iii.    <strong>Compliance with PCI Requirements</strong></h6><h6>If you elect to store “Account Data” or “Sensitive Authentication Data”, as those terms are defined by the PCI Standards, you must maintain a system compliant with the PCI Standards. If you do not comply with the PCI DSS, or if we are unable to verify your compliance with the PCI DSS, we may suspend your access to the Solution. If you intend to use a service provider to store or transmit Account Data, you must not share any data with the service provider until it verifies that the third party holds sufficient certifications under the PCI DSS, and notify us of your intention to share Account Data with the service provider.</h6><h6>iv.    <strong>Notice of Security Incidents</strong></h6><h6>If you become aware of any misuse or compromise or unauthorized or accidental loss, destruction, alteration, disclosure or acquisition of or access to Program Data in your possession, custody or control, (a “<strong>Security Incident</strong>”), or reasonably suspects that a Security Incident has occurred, you must immediately report the suspected or actual Security Incident to us upon becoming aware of the Security Incident, but in no case later than 48 hours after you become aware of the Security Incident. Such report will summarize in reasonable detail the effect on the Program, if known, the nature of the Security Incident (including, if known, the categories and approximate number of individuals and Confidential Information records affected, and the likely consequences of the Security Incident) and all other relevant details.</h6><h6>v.    <strong>Response to Security Incident</strong></h6><h6>You must promptly take all necessary and advisable corrective actions and will cooperate with us in all reasonable and lawful efforts to prevent, mitigate, or rectify such Security Incident. You must take reasonable steps to investigate, prevent the recurrence of, and remedy the Security Incident (which will include appropriate instructions to your affiliates and service providers, if applicable). You must provide us with commercially reasonable assurances as we or our partners may request that such Security Incident is not likely to recur. If we or our partners reasonably believe that the security measures put in place by you (including the security measures of the affiliates and service providers) are insufficient to prevent future Security Incidents, we may provide guidance to you regarding prevention of Security Incidents, and require that you take additional measures to prevent additional Security Incidents. In no event will the guidance provided, or additional measures required, by us exempt you from liability for any future Security Incidents.</h6><h6>vi.    <strong>Disclosure to Third Parties</strong></h6><h6>Except as may be required by Applicable Law or industry rules, you will not inform any third party of any Security Incident without our prior written consent. If Applicable Law requires disclosure of the Security Incident, you will collaborate with us regarding the content of the disclosure in order to minimize any potential adverse impact upon us, our partners, customers and any other third party affected by the Security Incident. The content of any filings, communications, notices, press releases or reports related to any Security Incident will be subject to our written approval prior to their publication or communication. In addition to all remedies available to us under Applicable Law, we will be entitled to all available equitable remedies in the event of a Security Incident or threat of a Security Incident and may seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction without the necessity of proving actual loss.</h6><p>c) <strong>Licenses and Intellectual Property</strong></p><h6>i.     <strong>Software License Grant to You</strong></h6><h6>We grant you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free limited license to access and/or use our API, Services, developer toolkits, dashboard, documentation and other software (collectively, the “Lithic IP”) in accordance with the accompanying documentation made available by us for purposes of using the Services.
