Why do companies choose Lithic?
Direct Network Integrations
Direct Visa and Mastercard network integrations and a native core system mean fewer third party dependencies, happier developers, better economics, and easier implementations.

True Platform Scalability
Lithic is the only platform where you can go live with a program managed offering and then take control of your stack as you scale. Or you can become your own program manager on day one.

Full Stack Freedom
Mix and match partners and infrastructure providers to power your unique product and business vision. Our flexible API allows you to pick your sponsor bank, ledger, and KYC/KYB flows.


“Lithic has been a best-in-class partner. They’ve been reliable, intuitive, and customer-focused, and their modular approach has enabled us to handle scale with ease. All of that has meant using Lithic for new card products was an easy decision.”

Developer Experience
Lithic was born of our own technical needs when we launched a virtual card product in 2014. From day one, we experienced first-hand how painful APIs, documentation, dashboards, and customer support could be if executed poorly.
